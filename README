FUDO README
===========

fudo is a wrapper for doas to translate sudo commands to doas
commands. Because sudo provides a wider range of features on the
command line, many sudo flags can't be converted to doas flags. For
example, sudo's `--preserve-env` has no doas equivalent. However,
`keepenv` or `setenv` can always be explicitly defined in `doas.conf`
to produce the same effect.

Therefore, fudo translates what flags it can and ignores those it
can't.


Building & Installation
=======================

While in fudo's source directory, run:

    $ make

Afterwards, you may install it by doing as root:

    # install fudo /usr/bin/fudo
    # ln -s /usr/bin/fudo /usr/bin/sudo


Using fudo
==========

After installing as stated above, any `sudo` command will be converted
to a `doas`. By default, `fudo` shows the command translation to
stderr. For example,

    $ sudo whoami
    fudo <<< sudo whoami
    fudo >>> /usr/bin/doas whoami
    root

You can disable this by setting the environment variable FUDO_HIDE.

    $ export FUDO_HIDE=
    $ sudo whoami
    root

fudo also passes the environment variables `SUDO_USER`, `SUDO_UID`,
and `SUDO_GID` to `doas`. If you're using devtools on Arch Linux, this
is using when doing a clean chroot build via `extra-x86_64-build`
which takes advantage of these environment variables to ease creating
a chroot. Therefore, in `doas.conf`, you'd want a setup similar to:

    permit nopass setenv { SUDO_USER SUDO_UID SUDO_GID } foobar as root
    permit nopass root as foobar
